# My QA TCs and bug reports for the course QA - Manual Software Testing

These are all of the TCs and bug reports that I have written for my course.

Test cases are written for the e-commerce store
[https://automationpractice.com/](url) and for a internal application
which works as a portal based app. User is able to
create an account, and the add, modify or delete articles.
It is also possible to comment on articles and submit them,
as well as to delete the comments.

Bugs reports are written for real production websites,
as well as internal app.
